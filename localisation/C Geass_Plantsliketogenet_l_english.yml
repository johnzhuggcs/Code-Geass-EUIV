 unhappyPrince.1.t:0 "Coup of Taihe Gate"
 unhappyPrince.1.d:0 "For decades your Empire has been rotting away under the heavy bureacracy. The great aristocratic families of yore have only taken advantage of your benevolence, using the guise of Equal Wealth to monopolize the industries and distribution of the Empire. Your sickly Crown Prince has been fighting against their influences for years without avail, only earning their ire and petitions for you to exile him. Today, on your death bed, these scheming aristocrats plan to force you to abdicate to your brilliant yet sympathetic second son, the Prince of Xiu. Hearing the news from a group of eunuchs, your eldest has lead a contingent of rebellious Imperial Guards towards the Taihe Palace Gate. Your son has demanded an audience, pleading for you to save the crumbling Empire. But fear not, the Prince of Xiu stands ready with the Qianniu Guards in front of the gate, confronting his brother. The Imperial Guards under the control of the aristocrats are also on their way. Now you must decide who to pass the Dragon Throne to, for all will be watching."
 unhappyPrince.1.a:0 "No, my eldest has done nothing wrong, I will not deny his heirloom!"
 unhappyPrince.1.b:0 "Ungrateful spawn! Send messenger to the Marquess of Chenxing."
 unhappyPrince.2.t:0 "Capture of the Crown Prince"
 unhappyPrince.2.d:0 "As your eldest looks at you with his defiant gaze, despite the floor covered with his coughed up blood, you feel but a sense of pity. Sending the disgraced Prince away, the Prince of Xiu begs for his brother's mercy. But the Marquess of Chenxing looms over your disease-ridden figure, quietly asserting the dangers of ambitious Crown Princes and scheming eunuchs. Turning around, he glanced at the Prince of Xiu before ordering his soldiers to execute the screaming eunuchs."
 unhappyPrince.2.a:0 "Righteous above blood, so said the Sage of Spring and Autumn"
 unhappyPrince.3.t:0 "Crown Prince Triumph!"
 unhappyPrince.3.d:0 "Despite the watchful eyes of the Aristocratic faction, your loyal eunuchs managed to deliver the abdictation decree to all the barracks of the Vermillion Palace. Surpringsly, the Qianniu Guards under the Prince of Xiu were able to muster other units by the time the Marquess of Chenxing arrived. In a turn of events, the Imperial brothers joined forces to rout the Marquess's army and marched upon the others in their faction. Finally returning to your room, your eldest sits in a wheel-chair as his brother pushes him from behind, smiling victoriously as their gambit succeeded."
 unhappyPrince.3.a:0 "I am glad to see you brothers together, I can finally go see your mothers..."
 tianzi.1.t:0 "Your Flesh and Blood"
 tianzi.1.d:0 "Years have passed since you've ascending to the Dragon Throne. Despite constant medical attention, your condition has worsened. You are suspecting if you can ever father another child after your 2-yr old Lihua.  Your younger brother, the newly promoted Prince of Xian, and the Grand Marshal of Heavenly Strategem, serves you loyally and brilliantly ever since your childhood years.  Custom dictates that you invest him as the new Crown Prince, and the Ministers' petitions have only increased as you inch towards your death. But your close eunuch, Gao Hai, have been reminding you of the unfortunate fates of past Emperors with no sons, forever delegated to a small corner in the Imperial Mausoleum and the Temple, with no flesh and blood to offer sacrifices. Besides, you worry about Princess Lihua's fate under your brother, you've seen how ruthless he can get towards those who impeded on your mutual path. What would he do to your precious daughter?"
 tianzi.1.a:0 "Lihua is my flesh and blood. Summon my brother would you?"
 tianzi.1.b:0 "*Cough* You overstep your boundaries Gao Hai!*Cough*"
